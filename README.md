[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Project2Team1/Pequod.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Project2Team1/Pequod)

This program seeks to educate users who are interested in a brief, basic introduction to the world of cryptocurrency trading. 

## Instructions

* Users should interact with the provided cryptocurrencies, buying them when their prices decrease and selling them when they increase. 

### User: The Interested Learner

* This user interacts with the provided coins, examining the way in which the prices of each coin fluctuate independantly of each other.

* They see that the values of the coins change regularly, while the value of the money in their ledger remains static over time; this way, they realize that they can make more money by investing their ledger into various coins.

* The regularity of the price fluctuations teaches the basic concept of a fluid market; buy low, sell high!

### User: The teacher administrator

* Teachers and educators can take this project a step further, encouraging students to create their own currencies and adding them to the native server-side database via the administrative tools built into the software.

* This way, teachers can customize the content of the main educational tool to suit their own ends, building coins that are themed around their classrooms and lesson plans.
